Sol-Arena is an exhilarating 2D hack-and-slash arena survival game. Within this project, we incorporate a Facial Expression Recognition system. The outcomes of this system play a pivotal role in implementing a Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment feature in the game, aiming to enhance the overall gameplay experience for users.
